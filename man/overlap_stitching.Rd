\title{Stitch overlapping detector regions}
\usage{
overlap_stitching(
  spectra,
  method = "average",
  overlap1 = NULL,
  overlap2 = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{A ruffs_spectra object (typically from SVC)}

\item{method}{Stitching method for overlap regions. Options:
\describe{
\item{"average"}{Average values in overlap region (default)}
\item{"first"}{Use values from first detector}
\item{"second"}{Use values from second detector}
\item{"linear_blend"}{Linear interpolation between detectors}
}}

\item{overlap1}{Numeric vector of length 2 defining VNIR-SWIR1 overlap region (nm).
If NULL, uses metadata from spectra or defaults to c(990, 1010)}

\item{overlap2}{Numeric vector of length 2 defining SWIR1-SWIR2 overlap region (nm).
If NULL, uses metadata from spectra or defaults to c(1790, 1810)}
}
\value{
A ruffs_spectra object with stitched data (no duplicate wavelengths)
}
\description{
Resolves overlapping wavelength regions between detectors where overlap removal has not occured.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read SVC data
spec <- svcreader("sample.sig")

# Stitch overlaps using averaging
spec_stitched <- overlap_stitching(spec)

# Use first detector in overlaps
spec_first <- overlap_stitching(spec, method = "first")

# Custom overlap regions
spec_custom <- overlap_stitching(spec, 
                                  overlap1 = c(995, 1005),
                                  overlap2 = c(1795, 1805))
}
