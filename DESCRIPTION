Description: The R sUite For Field Spectroscopy Package. Developed by the Natural
    Environment Research Council Field Spectroscopy Facility, under the National
    Centre for Earth Observation. This package reads and processes raw data acquired
    from Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., Spectra Vista Corporation, and Spectral Evolution
    field spectrometers. It provides functions for the interpolation, overlap removal,
    and jump correction of spectral data. It also provides functions for the grouping
    and statistical treatment (averaging, standard deviation) of large spectral data sets
    acquired using field spectrometers.
